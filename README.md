This is the Github repository for the master thesis "A Critical Analysis of DL-Learner's Class Expression Learning Capabilities based on the DLCC Benchmark".

Due to constraints in storage space and the maximum size of files, one folder and one file had to be compressed to a zip-file. Before being able to use the scripts in this repository, one has to unzip them. The zip files can be found here:
 - ./data/Configurations.zip (unzip it, so that it creates the folder ./data/Configurations/)
 - ./data/DL-Learner_outputs/SearchTree comparison/Rho_celoe/tc06_rho_celoe_SearchTree.zip

With this, the repository is set up.
